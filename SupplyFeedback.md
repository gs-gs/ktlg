# Supply feedback
KTLG utilises slack commands to allow tenant/project team members to supply feedback on the KTLG service or GoSource 
more generally. This is done with the _supply feedback_ command in the appropriate channel within slack. The syntax is 
`@ktlg supply feedback {multi-line body}`, for example
```
@ktlg supply feedback GoSource has a wonderful partner in our current projects, but there is a change in direction 
within our organisation and we'll be moving to use mySQL for some major upcoming work. Can GoSource support mySQL
as a hosted service similar to how you have done for PostgreSQL todate?
